## Overview

A one-stop website that answers your questions for space-travel!! Go explore planets/moons in our solar system that are screaming your name. Gear up to start your new life on a whole new planet (yayyy*screaming*). Also, you can check out the crew and interact with them to feel re-assured on your journey. Get informed about the whole people from start to finish.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

I've recently begun the front-end battle so, it's fair to say i'm a beginner. To create a solution for this challenge, i've used html , vanilla css and javascript.
I've used grid and flexbox throughout to reach a satisfied solution.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
